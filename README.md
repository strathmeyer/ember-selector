git clone git@github.com:strathmeyer/ember-selector.git
cd ember-selector
bower install
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```

Point your browser to `http://localhost:8000/`

# Editing

```
sudo npm install -g coffee-script
coffee -wc -o js/ coffeescript/

You can now edit the `.coffee` files and `.js` files will be generated.
If you add a new `.coffee` file, you'll have to restart the command.
